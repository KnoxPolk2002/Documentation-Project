# Offensive 
Offensive classes are the main attack force of the team. Whether it's assaulting Control Points or grabbing the Intelligence, these classes focus on mobility. 

## Scout
Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky "in-your-face" attitude. He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/esde5dyq86h31.png?auto=webp&s=282ca90c28061cab9f86c3a7020f0a60de2c2b92)

Scout's main ability is his unmatched speed and agility, being the quickest class on his feet. This makes him the prime canidate for quickly manuvering around the enemy team and catching them by surprise. You may want to be careful, since his incredible speed means he has the lowest amount of health out of any character. So it's bst to play scout with the mindset of getting in quick and dealing damage, but not sticking around too long for the enemies to retaliate. 

##### Weapons

* Scout's primary weapon is that of the Scattergun; This double-barrel shotgun is good for a blast of damage at close range, but fairly ineffective from farther away.
* His secondary weapon is the Pistol; Good for dealing a fair bit of damage from a far distance, but harder to aim up close. 
* Finally, his melee weapon is the Baseball Bat; Super useful for delivering one solid hit on a enemy up close.

## Soldier
The Soldier is a crazed, jingoistic patriot from Midwest, USA. Tough and well-armed, he is versatile, capable of both offense and defense, and a great starter class to get familiar with the game.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRIjWmRDplI/maxresdefault.jpg)

Soldier is the most well rounded class in Team Fortress 2. With a solid speed, reasonable health, and decent damage he's a solid middle of the road choice. However, this means he does not do anything particularly special. So if you're looking for a unique classes with a fun gimmick you may want to choose one of the other eight mercanaries.

##### Weapons

* Soldier's primary weapon is a Rocket Launcher; Able to deal incredible damage, but takes a while to make it to it's target.
* His secondary weapon is the Shotgun; For a quick and powerful burst of damage most effective at close range. 
* For the Soldier's melee weapon, he utilizes his trusty Shovel; Able to produce a fair bit of damage to a enemy in close range.

## Pyro 

The Pyro is a mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related. As shown in Meet the Pyro, the Pyro appears to be insane and delusional, living in a utopian fantasy world.

![Mac Screenshot](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2725858.jpg)

Pyro is best at one thing, close range crowd control. With his homemade flamethrower Pyro is able to handle a crowd of enemies with relative ease. By right-clicking when equipped with the Flamethrower, you're able to release a powerful blast of compressed air to push back any players your feel maybe to close for your liking.

##### Weapons

* Pyro's primary weapon is the Flamethrower; Able to control a crowd and look cool while doing it, but can't stay lit forever.
* His secondary weapon is the Shotgun; useful for punishing enemies who weren't detered by a masked maniac with a flamethrower.
* Pyro's melee weapon is an Axe; just in case the shotgun didn't work either.

# Defensive
Defensive classes serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups.

## Demoman
The Demoman is a self-described black Scottish cyclops and a scrumpy-swilling demolitions expert from Ullapool, Scotland, who is one of the most versatile members of the team. A master of explosives, the Demoman strategically deals massive amounts of indirect and mid-range splash damage.

## Heavy
The Heavy Weapons Guy, more commonly known as the Heavy, is a towering hulk of a man hailing from the USSR. He is the largest and possibly most dangerous class in Team Fortress 2. Boasting the most default health and devastating firepower from his trusty Minigun, the Heavy is no pushover.

## Engineer

The Engineer is a soft-spoken, amiable Texan from Bee Cave, Texas, USA with an interest in all mechanical things. He specializes in constructing and maintaining Buildings that provide support to his team, rather than fighting at the front lines, making him the most suitable for defense.

# Support
Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. 

## Medic
The Medic is a Teutonic man of medicine from Stuttgart, Germany. While he may have a tenuous adherence to medical ethics, he is nonetheless the primary healing class of the team.

## Sniper
Hailing from the lost country of New Zealand and raised in the unforgiving Australian outback, the Sniper is a tough and ready crack shot. The Sniper's main role on the battlefield is to pick off important enemy targets from afar using his Sniper Rifle and its ability to deal guaranteed critical hits with a headshot (with some exceptions).

## Spy
Hailing from an indeterminate region of France, the Spy is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives. Using a unique array of cloaking watches, he can render himself invisible or even fake his own death, leaving unaware opponents off-guard. His Disguise Kit lets him take on the form of any class on either team, allowing him to blend in while behind enemy lines before stabbing his unsuspecting "teammates" in the back.
