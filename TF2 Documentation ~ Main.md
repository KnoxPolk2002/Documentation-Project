##### Return to [Main](#main) 

# Offensive 
Offensive classes are the main attack force of the team. Whether it's assaulting Control Points or grabbing the Intelligence, these classes focus on mobility. 

## Scout
Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky "in-your-face" attitude. He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/esde5dyq86h31.png?auto=webp&s=282ca90c28061cab9f86c3a7020f0a60de2c2b92)

Scout's main ability is his unmatched speed and agility, being the quickest class on his feet. This makes him the prime canidate for quickly manuvering around the enemy team and catching them by surprise. You may want to be careful, since his incredible speed means he has the lowest amount of health out of any character. So it's bst to play scout with the mindset of getting in quick and dealing damage, but not sticking around too long for the enemies to retaliate. 

##### Weapons

* Scout's primary weapon is that of the Scattergun; This double-barrel shotgun is good for a blast of damage at close range, but fairly ineffective from farther away.
* His secondary weapon is the Pistol; Good for dealing a fair bit of damage from a far distance, but harder to aim up close. 
* Finally, his melee weapon is the Baseball Bat; Super useful for delivering one solid hit on a enemy up close.

## Soldier
The Soldier is a crazed, jingoistic patriot from Midwest, USA. Tough and well-armed, he is versatile, capable of both offense and defense, and a great starter class to get familiar with the game.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qRIjWmRDplI/maxresdefault.jpg)

Soldier is the most well rounded class in Team Fortress 2. With a solid speed, reasonable health, and decent damage he's a solid middle of the road choice. However, this means he does not do anything particularly special. So if you're looking for a unique classes with a fun gimmick you may want to choose one of the other eight mercanaries.

##### Weapons

* Soldier's primary weapon is a Rocket Launcher; Able to deal incredible damage, but takes a while to make it to it's target.
* His secondary weapon is the Shotgun; For a quick and powerful burst of damage most effective at close range. 
* For the Soldier's melee weapon, he utilizes his trusty Shovel; Able to produce a fair bit of damage to a enemy in close range. 

If you want to see more of Soldier's personality, click **[here](https://youtu.be/h42d0WHRSck)** to view the Meet the Soldier trailer.

## Pyro 

The Pyro is a mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related. As shown in Meet the Pyro, the Pyro appears to be insane and delusional, living in a utopian fantasy world.

![Mac Screenshot](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2725858.jpg)

Pyro is best at one thing, close range crowd control. With his homemade flamethrower Pyro is able to handle a crowd of enemies with relative ease. By right-clicking when equipped with the Flamethrower, you're able to release a powerful blast of compressed air to push back any players your feel maybe to close for your liking.

##### Weapons

* Pyro's primary weapon is the Flamethrower; Able to control a crowd and look cool while doing it, but can't stay lit forever.
* His secondary weapon is the Shotgun; useful for punishing enemies who weren't detered by a masked maniac with a flamethrower.
* Pyro's melee weapon is an Axe; just in case the shotgun didn't work either.

# Defensive
Defensive classes serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups.

## Demoman
The Demoman is a self-described black Scottish cyclops and a scrumpy-swilling demolitions expert from Ullapool, Scotland, who is one of the most versatile members of the team. A master of explosives, the Demoman strategically deals massive amounts of indirect and mid-range splash damage.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/han3AfjH210/maxresdefault.jpg)

Demoman is one of the more strategic characters in TF2. The grenades he fires are able to deal massive amounts of damage to enemy players, even if they were not the primary target. His sticky grenades also allow for one to cover alter routes the enemy team may take, blocking their pathes and leading to many players dying if hidden well enough. 

##### Weapons

* Demoman's primary weapon is his basic Grenade Launcher; Useful for inflicting huge amounts of damage on enemies wihtout having to aim as carefully.
* His secondary weapon is his Sticky Grenade Launcher; Letting him carefully place grenades that will explode once an enemy is in close proximity. 
* Finally his melee is his Scrumpy Bottle; similar to other melee weapons, it is useful for dealing reasonable damage from a close range.

## Heavy
The Heavy Weapons Guy, more commonly known as the Heavy, is a towering hulk of a man hailing from the USSR. He is the largest and possibly most dangerous class in Team Fortress 2. Boasting the most default health and devastating firepower from his trusty Minigun, the Heavy is no pushover.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jHgZh4GV9G0/maxresdefault.jpg)

Heavy's name pretty much speaks for itself. Heavy is the character with the most health in the game along with one of the highest damage outputs. Heavy is the class you want on the front lines to deal damage and take hits. He is, however, the slowest of all the classes, so if you are out in the open for too long, you may run out of health. However, when paired with a Medic, Heavy's is a bit more difficult to take down. 

##### Weapons

* His primary fire is his Minigun; This fully-automatic machine gun shoots at a rapid pace and deals considerable damage, but is a little slow to aim.
* Heavy's secondary weapon is the Shotgun; similar to other class's secondaries, it is good with dealing a lot of damage from a close distance.
* Then his melee weapon is not even a weapon, it's his Fists; using your fists allows you to deal damage from close range but leaves you even more open than usual.

## Engineer

The Engineer is a soft-spoken, amiable Texan from Bee Cave, Texas, USA with an interest in all mechanical things. He specializes in constructing and maintaining Buildings that provide support to his team, rather than fighting at the front lines, making him the most suitable for defense.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNgNBsCI4EA/maxresdefault.jpg)

Engineer is one of the most unique classes in the game, as most of the damage done from him is actually done by the machines he deploys. The key to playing Engineer is to pick critical points of interest on the battlefield to make is harder for the enemy team to advance and to improve your own team's chances. Be careful though, because once those machines are destroyed you are pretty defenseless. 

##### Weapons

* Engineer's primary is a Shotgun; Useful for close range and fairly useless for long range. 
* His secondary is a Pistol; Much more useful for long range fire fights.
* Then Engineer's melee is a Wrench; Fitting of the handy man of the team
* Finally Engineer has his Construction PDA; This allows him to build his machines including Turrents, Healing Stations, and Teleporters.

# Support
Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. 

## Medic
The Medic is a Teutonic man of medicine from Stuttgart, Germany. While he may have a tenuous adherence to medical ethics, he is nonetheless the primary healing class of the team. 

![Macdown Screenshot](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZkOGRjNzAtNjNiNC00OWFlLTg0OWYtMTc2MjVhYjNlYWUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc3OTE4Nzk@._V1_.jpg)

Medic is one of the msot important classes in the game. His unique ability to heal his teammates make him a vital asset to keeping his team fitting long enough to secure objectives. But this makes him a more defenseless character, meaning your teammates need to make sure you're properly defended to be the best Medic you can be.

##### Weapons

* Medic's primary weapon is his Syringe Gun; Not the most powerful weapon avaliable, but can do a bit of damage to get you out of situations. 
* His secondary is his Medi Gun; This is the device that gives the Medic his name. Using it allows you to heal others, and you can even go UBER once healing a player, which makes you and the player you are healing invincible for a short time.
* Finally his melee is a simple Bonesaw; functions like most other melee weapons.

## Sniper
Hailing from the lost country of New Zealand and raised in the unforgiving Australian outback, the Sniper is a tough and ready crack shot. The Sniper's main role on the battlefield is to pick off important enemy targets from afar using his Sniper Rifle and its ability to deal guaranteed critical hits with a headshot (with some exceptions).

![Macdown Screenshot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NZDwZbyDus/maxresdefault.jpg)

Sniper is another self explainitory class, with him being excellent and long range. It is best to keep sniper far way from the main conflict you team is facing and picking off enemy players from a distance. Because if enemies get too close, you may have trouble fighting back.

##### Weapons

* His primary weapon is his Sniper Rifle; Excellent at long range, but very poor for short range. 
* Sniper's secondary is an SMG; Good for a midrange fight, but a bit more lackluster for long range and short range.
* Then his melee weapon Kukri; A machete like blade useful for fighting in close range. 

If you want to see more of Sniper's personality, click **[here](https://youtu.be/9NZDwZbyDus)** to view the Meet the Sniper trailer.


## Spy
Hailing from an indeterminate region of France, the Spy is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives. Using a unique array of cloaking watches, he can render himself invisible or even fake his own death, leaving unaware opponents off-guard. His Disguise Kit lets him take on the form of any class on either team, allowing him to blend in while behind enemy lines before stabbing his unsuspecting "teammates" in the back.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://s1.dmcdn.net/v/SJXYw1Wvmx7MfDlKJ/x1080)

Spy is probably the most difficult but rewarding classes in Team Fortress 2 to play as. His unique ability to change his appearence to enemy players make him extremely dangerous when in the right hands. He also can use an EMP device to shutdown Engineer's machines and has a switchblade that when used on any enemy's back instantly kills them. Definitely a powerful class but can be easily killed once discovered by the enemy team.

##### Weapons

* Spy does not have a primary weapon, instead he has gadgets like the Invis-Watch and the Sapper. These allow him to turn invisible and destroy enemy machines respectively. 
* His secondary weapon is a Revolver; Good for taking out enemy at long ranges.
* Then Spy has his melee, the Switchblade; Only as good as other melee weapons, util you attack from the back then it can instantly kill other players.
* Finally Spy has a Disguise Kit; Allowing him to disguise himself as enemy players and blend in amongst them.

# Game Modes 

Team Fortress 2 has a wide variety of game modes to choose from, it is one of the reasons the game is still being played nearly 15 years after it's initial launch in 2007. In every game mode you play on one of two teams, **RED** or **BLU**; This doesn't change anything other than your character's color scheme. Some of the most notable modes include *Attack / Defend, Capture the Flag, Control Points, King of the Hill, and Payload*. In the following sections will include detailed instructions on how to play each of these modes. 

Please refer to this list if you need to refer to a specific game mode:

* ***[ATTACK / DEFEND](#attack-/-defend)***
* ***[CAPTURE THE FLAG](#capture-the-flag)***
* ***[CONTROL POINTS](#control-points)***
* ***[KING OF THE HILL](#king-of-the-hill)***
* ***[PAYLOAD](#payload)***

## Attack / Defend
RED begins with all the points in their control. BLU wins if it captures all of RED's points. Points may only be captured in a set order. RED wins if it prevents BLU from capturing all points before the timer expires. Points captured by BLU are locked and cannot be captured again by RED.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/1/1f/GravelPitDefense.jpg/500px-GravelPitDefense.jpg)



## Capture the Flag
Capture the Flag features both RED and BLU bases, each containing its own Intelligence briefcase (also known as the "flag"). The goal for both teams is to capture the enemy's Intelligence until they have reached the game's capture limit (default limit is 3 captures) while preventing the enemy team from achieving the same.

![Macdown](https://teamwork.tf/images/quickplay/gamemode/ctf.png)

## Control Points
Control points are circular platforms with a team-colored light and hologram in the center (neutral points will have a white light and hologram). To capture a point owned by the enemy team, the player simply stands on the point until the capture meter fills with his or her team color. The more players on a point, the faster it will capture, though only to a limited extent. Scouts, as well as Soldiers/Demomen with the Pain Train equipped, count as 2 players when capturing control points. Capture progress will not be made when players of both teams are on the control point. If all the capturing players are killed or driven off before the capture is completed, the capture progress will not reset immediately, but instead will slowly fade away.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3b719c4c3ee96047ed4afb4a0f5e3086/tumblr_o2v5im86eP1uz6nd0o1_1280.jpg)

## King of the Hill
King of the Hill focuses on a single control point at the center of the map, which is neutral and locked at the beginning of the round. Teams must make their way to the control point and capture it when it becomes available. Once the point is captured by a team, their team clock will start a three-minute countdown. If the enemy team manages to capture the point back, their clock will start counting down while the other team’s clock freezes at the time the point was recaptured. A team wins once they own the point, the three minutes countdown expires, and the other team's capture progress is gone.

![Macdown Screenshot](https://w0.peakpx.com/wallpaper/911/192/HD-wallpaper-tf2-heavy-king-of-the-hill-valve-team-fortress-2-heavy-medic-tf2.jpg)

## Payload
BLU team must escort a cart full of explosives through a series of checkpoints and into RED's base within a certain amount of time. BLU team members move or 'push' the cart by standing next to it — the more people next to the cart, the faster it moves (up to a maximum capture rate of three). Any RED team member standing near the cart will stop it from venturing further, regardless of the number of BLU team members on the cart. If no BLU players push the cart for 30 seconds, the cart will start moving backward slowly until it reaches a checkpoint, BLU spawn, an uphill slope (in certain maps), or is pushed by BLU team members again, which will also reset the timer. The cart functions as a level 1 Dispenser for BLU team (and disguised enemy Spies) to restore health and ammunition to those pushing it. Ammunition is not restored to players standing at the front of the cart.
